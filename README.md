This project is my fully-functional attempt at implementing a pannable, zoomable
canvas with [jCanvas](https://projects.calebevans.me/jcanvas/). You can view the
demo online [here](https://projects.calebevans.me/jcanvas-panzoom-demo/).

To view the demo locally, clone the project and open `index.html` in a web
